<h1>Welcome to the Cybersecurity Spec Trial Day</h1>
<section class="section" id="introduction-to-the-cybersecurity-specialization">
<h2>Introduction to the Cybersecurity Specialization</h2>
<section class="section" id="background">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity has been an important part of technology since computer
networks have existed – for about 50 years. Over time, as the Internet
and connectivity in general have grown, security needs have grown right
along with them. Cybersecurity encompasses protecting hardware, software,
and data from attacks, theft, disruption, and damage. Security engineers
are tasked with making sure systems are dependable and safe.</p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="introduction-to-specializations">
<h3>Introduction to Specializations</h3>
<p>During Specializations, you will take a huge step towards your career in tech by not only
attaining skills in a particular technology area or stack, but also by getting accustomed to a
new work style that resembles the way you will work and learn in your first job. Your coding
bootcamp experience is technically over, and now you will begin your journey within the
technology industry.</p>
<p>Throughout your career as a Security Analyst or Engineer, you will need to continue
to learn and gain new skills. Developers will do this by carefully researching new
technologies, following online video tutorials, and practicing learned concepts. We designed
the Specializations program to mimic that learning experience. To do this, we’ve leveraged
a combination of video learning and carefully curated exercises. We also provide support
through multiple avenues including: daily stand-ups with your Tech Lead, weekly review
sessions, weekly one-on-one meetings with your Subject Matter Expert (SME), and queue support
during your class hours.</p>
<p>While this new learning environment will help prepare you for your first role and continued
learning, it will also present unique challenges for you to conquer. Some of these challenges
include: time management, self-awareness, and video fatigue. Overcoming these challenges at
Devmountain, while you have support, will help build the foundation for your growth as an
engineer.</p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="what-you-will-learn">
<h3>What You Will Learn</h3>
<p>This course prepares students with the knowledge and skills to start a career as a Cybersecurity
Analyst or Cybersecurity Engineer, providing all requisite knowledge of modern security practices,
attack prevention, access management, and incident response.</p>
<p>In this course, you will learn about the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Basic Security Concepts</p></li>
<li><p>Network Security</p></li>
<li><p>DevSecOps</p></li>
<li><p>Threat Intelligence</p></li>
<li><p>Attack Vector Analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Vulnerability Management</p></li>
<li><p>Digital Forensics</p></li>
<li><p>Decision-Making</p></li>
<li><p>Incident Response &amp; ISO</p></li>
<li><p>Creating Security Policies</p></li>
</ul>

<section class="section" id="staff-during-specializations">
<h3>Staff During Specializations</h3>
<p><strong>Tech leads</strong> provide guidance, industry knowledge, and leadership during Specializations.
They are the primary leader throughout the day for students and ensure that students
are progressing with the support that they need. Tech Leads manage 1-2 technical programs
and communicate directly with Subject Matter Experts to escalate student questions. They
run daily Scrum Meetings, check in with students frequently, and monitor student progress.
They also help to maintain and update curriculum for their area(s).</p>
<p><em>Fun Fact: The role of the tech lead is modeled after the Team Lead in the tech industry. A
Team Lead is traditionally someone who is both an individual contributor but also coordinating
with team members and tracking and driving overall progress. While Team Leads are proactive in their
communication, it’s also important for the rest of the team to be proactive in keeping the Team
Lead up to date on blockers, progress, and other general information.</em>
<em>Tech leads do this and that…</em></p>
<p><strong>Subject Matter Experts</strong> answer student questions and provide feedback to students on
their comprehension of the material during weekly meetings. You can expect at minimum
one hour of one-on-one time with a SME each week during specialization, in addition to
any escalated questions you have the SMEs might answer either individually or with the
group based on collaboration with the Tech Lead.</p>
<p><em>Fun Fact: The SME role is modeled after Senior Engineers and SMEs (same name) within the tech industry.
In a real engineering org, SMEs and Senior Engineers are called upon to enable mid or junior level
folks when they run into blockers. As part of Specializations, you have the oppportunity to
work with real Subject Matter Experts with years of experience in the tech industry.
Not only will you learn things from them, you will also learn how to advocate for yourself
effectively. Working with SMEs on a less frequent basis than staff during Foundations will
enable you to build independence and confidence that will be invaluable when you
begin your first role within the tech industry.</em></p>

<h3>Project Setup</h3>
<p>Contact your instructor to get an access code for the labs.</p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="overview">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>InfoSec is a service that our Cybersecurity students use to complete labs. The labs provide detailed instructions
and a sandbox environment in which to practice the things that you will be learning.</p>
<p>Info on the first lab: Students will examine a network breach and be able to identify the indicators of a
compromise using a variety of command line and GUI (graphical user interface) utilities that will provide detailed
information about the attacker’s foothold into a compromised Windows Server.</p>
<p>Info on the second lab: In this lab you, will take advantage of the lack of disk encryption and exploit a local system.
When the operating system is not encrypted, an attacker with physical access can leverage this to their advantage and
gain access to your system using a number of freely available tools. Various tools such as Live DVDs or even the Windows
recovery console can provide ways for the attacker to see the files you have on your system as well as download or upload
malware and run it on your system.</p>
